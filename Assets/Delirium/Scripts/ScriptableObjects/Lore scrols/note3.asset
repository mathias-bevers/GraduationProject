  text: "1896, Jonathan Worthing\r\n\nI thought I\u2019d do the world a favour by
    throwing myself over board, but still I\u2019m cursed to life this miserable
    life. Now I\u2019ve washed up on this god-forsaken island with no one in sight.\r\n\u2026
    So be it.\r\n I\u2019ve found an old camp with a corpse. An old one, naught but
    bones and fancy clothing left now. Must\u2019ve been a rich one judging by his
    attire, ambushed by animals or the like.\r\n\r\nPoor bastard.. if only he was
    wise enough to notice his salvation was right around him all this time. This
    island is rich with Datura, a natural herb used for healing and calming the mind.
    Only the flower and some willow bark will do wonders.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too late
    for him now, but I\u2019ll make use of it. Time to head south east, to the main-land
    and inwards. Lets see if I can make a fresh start yet. \n\nDatura is found around
    the island\r.\nWillow is found around the island."
