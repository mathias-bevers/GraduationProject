  text: "Datura + Willow bark\r\nDatura is found around the island\r\nWillow bark
    is harvested from Willow trees\r\n\r\nA skull can be picked up at this location,
    near Philippe\u2019s skeletal remains.\r\n\r\n1896, Jonathan Worthing\r\nI thought
    I\u2019d do the world a favour by throwing myself over board, but still I\u2019m
    cursed to life this miserable life. Now I\u2019ve washed up on this god-forsaken
    island with no one in sight.\r\n\u2026 So be it.\r\n I\u2019ve found an old camp
    with a corpse. An old one, naught but bones and fancy clothing left now, missing
    its head. Must\u2019ve been a rich one judging by his attire, ambushed by animals
    or the like.\r\n\r\nPoor bastard.. if only he was wise enough to notice his salvation
    was right around him all this time. This island is rich with Datura, a natural
    herb used for healing and calming the mind. Only the flower and some willow bark
    will do wonders.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too late for him now, but I\u2019ll make use
    of it. Time to head south, to the main-land and inwards. Lets see if I can make
    a fresh start yet. "
