  text: "\n1743 Philippe of Bursbury\r\n\r\nI saw someone, but they ran away as soon
    as I called out. How dare he! I will pray to god it\u2019s because this barbarian
    either doesn\u2019t know common english or lacks ears, else we\u2019ll see how
    he responds to a noble son\u2019s wrath. \n\nI\u2019ll continue north to where
    I saw this cockroach scurry off to. He might be heading to the Island I saw earlier
    when I arrived. My eye caught a glimpse of ore situated on the shore, I\u2019ll
    have to make sure this rat keeps his greedy paws off MY rightful resources.\r"
