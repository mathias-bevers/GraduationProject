  text: "\n1896, Jonathan Worthing\r\n\r\nNo sign of a living soul yet, strangely
    no animals either, not even seagulls. I think I saw smoke rising from the east
    \u2013 I kept calling out but no one answered. Still, I should remain quiet in
    case the beasts are simply sleeping. I wouldn\u2019t want to end up like the
    poor bastard I found when I arrived.\r"
