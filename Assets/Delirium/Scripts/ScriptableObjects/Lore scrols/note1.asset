  text: "\n1743 Philippe of Bursbury\r\n\r\nI believe I\u2019ve discovered an uncharted
    Island! I\u2019ve double\u2014nay, triple checked at this point, and it doesn\u2019t
    line up in the slightest. Either Jeremiah sold me a faulty map, or I\u2019ll
    have discovered my very own land. Should it truly be uninhabited, I\u2019ll use
    the island\u2019s resources to build myself a mansion fit for a king. Why, if
    not \u2013 I\u2019ll round up the men and drive out the current peasant population.
    Now to see if I remember the very basics of survival father taught me and explore
    the place, a piece of flint should be enough to make a spark. \r\n\r\nDamned
    be the storm that drove my rowboat against the rocks! A proper hole in the hull
    if I\u2019ve ever seen one. I should blame the craftsmanship first and foremost..
    though the main ship should catch up soon enough. I believe I\u2019ll head deeper
    into the forest first, south by south-eastward and see if I cannot find something
    to eat now that I\u2019ve got a fire started.\r\n\nFlint is to be found at the
    shoreline.\r"
