  text: "\n1896, Jonathan Worthing\r\nThe writing is getting more erratic, scratchy.\r\n\r\nThey
    whisper at me in the night. A voice beckons me to the middle, it says they\u2019ll
    all go away as long as I surrender myself to the mist. They\u2019ll stop hunting
    me, clawing at me, tearing the flesh from my bones. I take the potion and my
    wounds close instantaneously. It has never done that before..\r\nI can\u2019t
    sleep. It\u2019ll catch me. \r\n\r\nI.\r\nMust.\r\nMove.\r\nOn.\r\n\r\nGO SOUTH
    WEST, STAY OUT OF THE MIST."
